(Product Requirements Document \(PRD\): FlowState) Tj
T* (1. Document Control) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (Product / Feature Name: FlowState \(The Vibe-Coded Productivity App\)) Tj
T* (Version: 1.0 \(MVP\)) Tj
T* (Author: Product Team) Tj
T* (Date: October 26, 2023) Tj
T* (Approvers: [Head of Product], [Engineering Lead], [Design Lead]) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (2. Executive Summary) Tj
T* (FlowState is an AI-first weekly productivity app designed to reduce) Tj
T* (executive dysfunction and alignment anxiety. Unlike traditional tools that) Tj
T* (act as rigid databases, FlowState functions as a fluid, adaptive partner.) Tj
T* (By leveraging Gemini 3.0, the app automates data entry via multimodal) Tj
T* (capture, dynamically adjusts schedules based on "liquid time" and user) Tj
T* (energy levels, and provides empathetic support through "body) Tj
T* (doubling." We are building this to help users shift from managing) Tj
T* (software to maintaining flow.) Tj
T* (3. Context &#x26; Background) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (Current state: Users currently juggle multiple apps \(Notes, Calendar,) Tj
T* (To-Do, Read-Later\) that do not communicate. Schedules are rigid; one) Tj
T* (missed task breaks the day, leading to users abandoning the system.) Tj
T* (Customer insights: Gen Z and Millennial users are experiencing) Tj
T* ("productivity dysmorphia"—the feeling of being busy but not productive.) Tj
T* (There is a high demand for "ADHD-friendly" tools that lower the barrier) Tj
T* (to entry \(friction\) and manage the emotional aspect of work.) Tj
T* (Competitive/market context:) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (Notion: Too manual; requires heavy setup \("Legos"\).) Tj
T* (Google Calendar: Rigid time blocks; lacks task context.) Tj
T* (Motion: High cost; feels corporate/aggressive rather than supportive.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* () Tj
T* () Tj
T* (Constraints: Heavy reliance on Gemini 3.0 API latency and cost; privacy) Tj
T* (concerns regarding reading personal content \(emails/screenshots\).) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (4. Problem Statement \(Outcome-Driven\)) Tj
T* (Users struggle to maintain consistency with rigid productivity tools,) Tj
T* (which causes "shame spirals" when tasks are missed and administrative) Tj
T* (burnout. A successful solution should enable users to capture inputs) Tj
T* (effortlessly and have their schedule adapt to their reality automatically.) Tj
T* (5. User Research &#x26; Insights) Tj
T* (5.1 Personas / JTBD) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (The Overwhelmed Creative: When I have a random idea or receive a) Tj
T* (wedding invite, I want to "dump" it somewhere instantly, so I can stop) Tj
T* (worrying about forgetting it without opening a form.) Tj
T* (The Cycle-Breaker: When I miss a deadline or a planned block, I want) Tj
T* (the schedule to fix itself, so I don't feel the urge to give up on the whole) Tj
T* (week.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (5.2 Pain Points) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (The "Wall of Awful": Large tasks feel insurmountable, leading to) Tj
T* (procrastination.) Tj
T* (Data Entry Friction: Typing out task details \(Title, Date, Time, Priority\) is) Tj
T* (too much effort in the moment.) Tj
T* (Rigid Scheduling: Life happens, but calendars treat missed slots as) Tj
T* (failures rather than data points.) Tj
T* (Context Switching: Moving from learning \(reading/watching\) to doing) Tj
T* (requires too many steps.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (6. Goals &#x26; Success Metrics) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (Business goals: Achieve top-tier retention rates \(D30 > 40%\) by creating) Tj
T* (an emotional reliance on the app's "empathy.") Tj
T* (User goals: Reduce "rescheduling time" to near zero; increase task) Tj
T* (completion rates via energy alignment.) Tj
T* (KPIs:) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (Capture Rate: % of items added via multimodal input vs. text.) Tj
T* (Flow Score: Ratio of completed vs. rescheduled tasks.) Tj
T* (Sanctuary Completion: % of WAU who complete the "Sunday) Tj
T* (Sanctuary" ritual.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* () Tj
T* () Tj
T* () Tj
T* (7. Scope) Tj

T* (User is notified of the new plan.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* () Tj
T* () Tj
